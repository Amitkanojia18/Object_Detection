# <b>Object_Detection<br></b>
Object Detection Model for Classifying Adults and Children
<br>
<B>This project utilizes an object detection model to classify individuals in video frames as either adults or children. The model is built using the following libraries:</B>
<br>
OpenCV: For video processing and displaying frames.<br>
YOLOv5: For object detection.<br>
Torch: For running the YOLOv5 model.<br>
<br>
Features<br>
Object Detection: Identifies objects in video frames and draws bounding boxes around them.<br>
Classification: Classifies detected individuals as 'Adult' or 'Child' based on their size.<br>

Prepare Your Videos: Place your video files in a folder named videos/ in the same directory as this script. Ensure that you have up to 8 videos named video_1.mp4, video_2.mp4, etc.<br>
<b>Run the Script :</b> Execute the script in your Python environment.<br>
<b>Input the Video Name :</b> When prompted, enter the full name of the video file (e.g., video_1.mp4). Ensure the file exists in the videos/ folder.<br>
<b>View Results :</b> The script will display the video with detected and labeled objects. Press 'q' to quit the video frame early.<br>

In this project, I have leveraged my skills in computer vision and deep learning to create an object detection model that classifies individuals in video frames as either adults or children. Utilizing libraries such as YOLOv5 for object detection, OpenCV for video processing, and PyTorch for model execution, I have developed a system that identifies and labels objects in real-time. Although the current implementation may exhibit some performance limitations, reflecting the complex nature of processing and analyzing video data, this project demonstrates my ability to tackle challenging problems and develop functional solutions. I am confident that, with further optimization and refinement, the system will achieve improved efficiency and responsiveness. This project not only highlights my technical capabilities but also my commitment to delivering effective and innovative solutions in the field of computer vision. Hope You will like it. Thanks for the Project though.
